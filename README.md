 Helply is a web-based platform designed to connect individuals who require 
assistance with everyday chores—such as babysitting, tuition, cleaning, and electrical 
work—with people willing to offer these services. It acts as a bridge between job 
seekers and job providers, offering a simple and accessible solution for both parties. 
The system supports two main user roles: employers, who can post specific job 
requirements, and workers, who can browse through available tasks based on their 
skills and preferences. Employers can select the service they need and view a list of 
available workers with their details and contact information. Workers, in turn, can 
view job listings, explore the job descriptions, and reach out to employers for 
opportunities. 
Helply addresses a real-world need for flexible job connections and provides a 
reliable environment for users to find or offer essential services within their 
communities.
